### Scope of Project

<i>To design and develop a multi-tier software system for managing co-op terms for the several co-op programs already offered by McGill University.</i></b>

<br/>As we progress throughout project, our goals will outline with the following:  
- All functionality of the system are accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.
- A mobile (Android) frontend shall allow to execute the most important functionality for the given stakeholder 
and have both read and write access to the backend via RESTful service calls.
- If time permits, will try to implement:
  - secure login with authorization (not mandatory).
  - External systems or services(myFuture, myCourses) (not mandatory).

### Sprint 1 
- [x] Use UML Lab to create a domain model
- [x] Implement a persistence layer using a Postgres database
- [x] Use the ORM technology Hibernate to map objects to database concepts
- [x] Create a Spring/Spring Boot project
- [x] Configure a build system using Gradle
- [x] Use a Continuous Integration process using Travis CI to build and test the database persistence layer
