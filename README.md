### Scope of Project

<i>To design and develop a multi-tier software system for managing co-op terms for the several co-op programs already offered by McGill University.</i></b>

<br/>As we progress throughout project, our goals will outline with the following:  
- All functionality of the system is accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.
- A mobile (Android) frontend shall allow to execute the most important functionality for the given stakeholder 
and have both read and write access to the backend via RESTful service calls.
- If time permits, will try to implement:
  - secure login with authorization (not mandatory).
  - External systems or services(myFuture, myCourses) (not mandatory).

## About

:sparkles: **CO-OP-ERATOR** is a multi-tier software system for managing co-op terms for engineering co-op programs.

This software system is subdivided into four deliverables:

- :one: [Deliverable 1](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-21/wiki/Deliverable-1-Report) - Requirements, Domain Modeling, Database Design
- :two: [Deliverable 2](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-21/wiki/Deliverable-2-Report) - Backend, Quality Assurance
- :three: Deliverable 3 - Web Frontend, Architecture
- :four: Deliverable 4 - Mobile Frontend, Availability

### Sprint 1 (Database)
- [x] Use UML Lab to create a domain model
- [x] Implement a persistence layer using a Postgres database
- [x] Use the ORM technology Hibernate to map objects to database concepts
- [x] Create a Spring/Spring Boot project
- [x] Configure a build system using Gradle
- [x] Use a Continuous Integration process using Travis CI to build and test the database persistence layer

## Deliverable 2 - Backend, Testing

### Sprint 2 (Backend)
- [-] Implement RESTful web service using Java Spring Boot
- [-] Provide a suite of unit tests for the backend using JUnit by separating it from the database.
- [-] Deploy the project as a Heroku application in addition to the constraints above.
