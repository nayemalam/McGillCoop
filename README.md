To do:
The team should provide a welcome page that introduces the team and describes the main scope of the project in the README.md file in the root of each teamâ€™s repository. In addition, the README.md file should contain an overview table with names, team roles and individual efforts (in hours) with separated entries for each deliverable (sample content will be provided).
Project Deliverable 1 shall be accompanied with a succinct project report as part of the project wiki which records the meeting minutes and the key design decisions taken by the team. This project report should be navigable from the README.md file of the project. Altogether, the team should comply with all Technological Constraints above.

## About

:sparkles:**CO-OP-ERATOR** is a multi-tier software system for managing co-op terms for engineering co-op programs.

This software system is subdivided into four deliverables:

- :one:Deliverable 1 - Requirements, Domain Modeling, Database Design
- :two:Deliverable 2 - Backend, Quality Assurance
- :three:Deliverable 3 - Web Frontend, Architecture
- :four:Deliverable 4 - Mobile Frontend, Availability

### Scope of Project

All functionality of the system are accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.
A mobile (Android) frontend shall allow to execute the most important functionality for the given stakeholder 
and have both read and write access to the backend via RESTful service calls.
Secure login with authorization is not mandatory. 
External systems or services(myFuture, myCourses) are not required to be integrated.

### Sprint 1 
- [x] Use UML Lab to create a domain model
- [x] Implement a persistence layer using a Postgres database
- [x] Use the ORM technology Hibernate to map objects to database concepts
- [x] Create a Spring/Spring Boot project
- [ ] Configure a build system using Gradle
- [ ] Use a Continuous Integration process using Travis CI to build and test the database layer
